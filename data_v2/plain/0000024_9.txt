Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version On This Page What is prevention? General Information About Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Prevention About This PDQ Summary What is prevention? Go to Health Professional Version Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer. To prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors . Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor. Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does not mean that you will not get cancer. Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including: Changing lifestyle or eating habits. Avoiding things known to cause cancer. Taking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting.

Oral cavity cancer forms in any of these tissues of the oral cavity: The lips. The front two thirds of the tongue. The gingiva (gums). The buccal mucosa (the lining of the inside of the cheeks). The floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue. The hard palate (the front, bony part of the roof of the mouth). The retromolar trigone (the small area behind the wisdom teeth ). Enlarge Anatomy of the oral cavity. The oral cavity includes the lips, hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), soft palate (the muscular back portion of the roof of the mouth), retromolar trigone (the area behind the wisdom teeth), front two-thirds of the tongue, gingiva (gums), buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the lips and cheeks), and floor of the mouth under the tongue. Pharyngeal cancer forms in any of these tissues of the pharynx (throat): The nasopharynx (the upper part of the throat behind the nose). The oropharynx , which includes the following tissues: The middle part of the throat behind the mouth. The back one third of the tongue. The soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth), including the uvula . The side and back walls of the throat. The tonsils . The hypopharynx (the bottom part of the throat). Cancers of the nasopharynx have causes, screening , risk factors , and treatment approaches which are distinct from other cancers of the pharynx. For more information, see Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment and Oral Cavity and Nasopharyngeal Cancers Screening . Enlarge Anatomy of the pharynx. The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The three parts of the pharynx are the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Laryngeal cancer forms in any of these tissues of the larynx (voice box): The supraglottis (the area above the vocal cords, including the epiglottis). The vocal cords (two small bands of muscle within the larynx that vibrate to produce the voice). The glottis (the middle part of the larynx, including the vocal cords). The subglottis (the lowest part of the larynx, from just below the vocal cords to the top of the trachea). Enlarge Anatomy of the larynx. The three parts of the larynx are the supraglottis (including the epiglottis), the glottis (including the vocal cords), and the subglottis. Oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer : Men are more than twice as likely as women to have oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer and die from it. Hypopharyngeal cancer : Hypopharyngeal cancer is rare. The number of new cases of hypopharyngeal cancer has slightly decreased over the past twenty years. The decrease in new cases is likely because of a decrease in cigarette smoking. Nasopharyngeal cancer : Nasopharyngeal cancer is rare in the United States. It is more common in parts of Asia, the Arctic region, North Africa, and the Middle East. Laryngeal cancer: Laryngeal cancer is less common than oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. The number of new cases of laryngeal cancer has slightly decreased over the past ten years. The decrease in new cases is likely because of a decrease in cigarette smoking. Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Prevention Key Points Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. The following are risk factors for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers: Tobacco use Alcohol use Tobacco and alcohol use Betel quid chewing Personal history of head and neck cancer The following is a risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection The following is a protective factor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers: Quitting smoking It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. New ways to prevent oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers are being studied in clinical trials. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having overweight , and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. Oral cavity , oropharyngeal , hypopharyngeal , and laryngeal cancers have common risk factors . The following are risk factors for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers: Tobacco use Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked, and is linked to how much and how long the person has smoked. The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes , pipes , cigars , and smokeless tobacco ( snuff and chewing tobacco ) can cause cancers of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . Alcohol use Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. The risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of these cancers is 2 to 6 times higher in people who have 2 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol use The risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal , hypopharyngeal , and laryngeal cancers is higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 5 to 14 times higher in people who both smoke and drink heavily than it is in people who never smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol. Betel quid chewing Chewing betel quid alone or with added tobacco has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. The risk of these cancers increases with how long and how often betel quid is chewed. The risk is higher when chewing betel quid with tobacco than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India. Personal history of head and neck cancer A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. The following is a risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Being infected with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV-16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancers. HPV infection may also increase the risk of some oral cavity cancers. HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact. The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral HPV-16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV-16 infection. The following is a protective factor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers: Quitting smoking Studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers decreases by one half (50%) within 5 to 9 years. Within 20 years of quitting, their risk of these cancers is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes. It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. Some studies show that when people stop drinking alcohol, their risk of oral cavity and laryngeal cancers decreases within about 20 years. Getting an HPV vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection. It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection. For information about the use of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer, see Cervical Cancer Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention . Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines , vitamins , minerals , or food supplements . New ways to prevent oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.
