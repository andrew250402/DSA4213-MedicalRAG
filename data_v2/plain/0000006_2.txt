Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Summary Index (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version On This Page General Information About Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Type of Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Latest Updates to This Summary (12/19/2023) About This PDQ Summary General Information About Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Primary brain tumors are a diverse group of diseases that together constitute the most common solid tumor of childhood. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) estimates that approximately 4,300 U.S. children are diagnosed each year.[ 1 ] Brain tumors are classified by histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are also important factors that affect treatment and prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of proliferative activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification.[ 2 ] References Ostrom QT, Gittleman H, Farah P, et al.: CBTRUS statistical report: Primary brain and central nervous system tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2006-2010.
