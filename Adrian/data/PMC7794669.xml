This procedure was performed with R software, version 3.5.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).</p><p>The radiotherapy-associated risk (RR) was estimated by using Poisson regression analysis with the relative risk and 95% CIs of SGMN development for patients with rectal cancer who received radiotherapy compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy, and the RRs were calculated with R software version 3.5.3. Then, Poisson regression analysis was used to calculate the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% CIs. The SIR was defined as the ratio of observed incidence SGMNs among rectal cancer survivors to the incidence of GMNs in the US general population. The SIRs were calculated with SEER*Stat 8.3.6. Both RRs and SIRs were adjusted for the age at rectal cancer diagnosis and the calendar year of rectal cancer diagnosis in our analysis. The details of statistical methods are shown in eFigure 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200984-1-s">Supplement</xref>. To further evaluate the dynamic risks and incidence for SGMNs associated with radiotherapy, we calculated the RRs and SIRs stratified by latency time since rectal cancer diagnosis, age at rectal cancer diagnosis, and year of rectal cancer diagnosis.</p><p>To evaluate the prognosis of SGMNs, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the 10-year overall survival for SGMNs and only primary GMN, and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values were calculated with the log-rank test. Overall survival was defined as the time from SGMN diagnosis to death from any cause. The only primary GMN was defined as the patients diagnosed with only GMN and without any other cancers throughout their lifetime. Propensity score matching was used to reduce possible bias for survival comparison. These analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-ZOI200984"><title>Results</title><sec id="H2-5-ZOI200984"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>A total of 22&#8201;589 patients with rectal cancer were identified (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200984-1-s">Supplement</xref>).

In our study, the key findings are as follows. First, radiotherapy was considered an important risk factor for the development of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer in patients with rectal cancer. Second, the incidence of cancer of the uterine corpus after radiotherapy was higher than that in the US general population. Third, the risks for developing cancer of the uterine corpus after radiotherapy increased with age, increased with diagnosis time, and decreased with latency, but the opposite trends were observed for ovarian cancer. Fourth, cancer of the uterine corpus after radiotherapy presented a poor prognosis.</p><p>Previous studies<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200984r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200984r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200984r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> assessing the risk of SGMNs after radiotherapy treatment for rectal cancer showed conflicting results (eTable 28 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200984-1-s">Supplement</xref>); there are several reasons for these variations in results, including the definition of SGMNs, latency period selection, length of follow-up duration, methodology and sample size of the cohort population. Birgisson et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and Wiltink et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> found that radiotherapy was not associated with an increased risk of developing SGMNs in patients with rectal cancer. However, only 8 and 10 SGMNs were observed in these 2 studies, which lacked statistical power to support their conclusions. Rombouts et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> reported that SGMNs (combined malignant neoplasms of the corpus uteri, cervix uteri, ovary, vulva, and vagina) occurred more frequently in patients with rectal cancer who received radiotherapy, but this study did not perform risk analyses for each type of SGMN. In addition, Kendal et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> found that an increased risk of developing SGMNs, including cancer of the uterine corpus and cervical cancer as 1 group, after radiotherapy treatment, but they did not consider the great heterogeneity among different types of GMNs. To better address this issue, we separately estimated the risk for each type of SGMN in our study.</p><p>The issue of latency cut-off point was determined to be associated with the risk of SPC occurrence after radiotherapy, which may be the main reason for the conflicting results regarding the risk of developing ovarian cancer from different studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Wang et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported that preoperative radiotherapy increased the risk of SPCs in the uterus but not the cervix or ovary after a latency period of more than 1 year. Similarly, Warschkow et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> performed a cohort study to evaluate the risk for SPCs with a 1-year latency after radiotherapy treatment for rectal cancer and found that an increased risk of SGMNs after rectal cancer involved malignant neoplasms of the endometrium only, not the ovary, cervix, or vulva. In our study, we identified SGMNs that occurred after a 5-year latency because the 5-year latency period from radiotherapy exposure to solid tumor occurrence allowed for a more reasonable conclusion to be drawn.<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> To further confirm the latency influence on risk evaluation, we repeatedly analyzed the risk of SGMN using a 1-year cut-off latency, and found that the risk for cancer of the uterine corpus after radiotherapy continued to be increased, but no risk for other types of SGMNs.</p><p>The statistical methods used for analysis are essential for the interpretation of the results. We used both competing risk regression and Poisson regression to assess the risk of SGMNs. Herein, we assessed the increased risks of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer after radiotherapy, but other types of SGMNs presented conflicting results according to different statistical method. We compared the incidence of SGMNs in patients who survived rectal cancer to the US general population, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the association between radiotherapy and the incidence of SGMNs.</p><p>In our analyses, we assessed the dynamic risk and incidence of SGMNs. The highest radiotherapy-associated risk for developing ovarian cancer was found after a latency of more than 20 years, but for cancer of the uterine corpus, the highest risk was within 5 to 10 years. This finding suggests that long-term follow-up may be warranted for the detection of ovarian cancer after radiotherapy, but follow-up for cancer of the uterine corpus should be considered in the early latency. An increased risk of cancer of the uterine corpus was observed with increasing age at diagnosis but was significantly decreased for ovarian cancer. This finding showed that both young patients and patients aged 50 years or older with rectal cancer who underwent radiotherapy faced a high risk of cancer of the uterine corpus. The mechanism underlying these opposite results between cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer warrants further study. Despite the improvements in radiotherapy treatment for rectal cancer in recent decades associated with better local control, our findings showed that the risk of cancer of the uterine corpus increased to 2.7-fold from 1975 to 1984 and gradually increased to 5.0-fold after 2005. This finding may be associated with changes in radiotherapy dose and radiotherapy modality over time. During the study period from 1973 to 2015, radiotherapy treatment modality has shifted toward hypofractionation, which may underlie the higher incidence of cancer of the uterine corpus in more recent years.</p><p>Compared with nonradiotherapy-associated GMNs, the clinical phenotype and prognosis of radiotherapy-associated SGMNs may present great heterogeneity. In our study, we found that patients with radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus had worse survival than matched control patients with only primary cancer of the uterine corpus. However, no survival differences between radiotherapy-associated GMNs and only primary GMNs were observed for other types of GMNs. This finding suggests that the occurrence of radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus might be due to the induction of other genetic signaling pathways after radiotherapy exposure, which is different from the normal genetic pathway of only primary cancer of the uterine corpus development. Owing to the varied genetic phenotype, radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus is resistant to conventional treatment and presents worse prognosis. However, no genomic data in the SEER database could be used to interpret the genetic features of cancer of the uterine corpus after radiotherapy exposure.</p><sec id="H2-10-ZOI200984"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strengths of the present study include a long follow-up period to discover potential SGMNs as well as a large observation population with relatively homogenous treatment exposure identified from the SEER database. This study has limitations. First, a lack of randomization of the initial treatment for rectal cancer may be associated with potential biases. However, the occurrence of SGMNs may not only be associated with radiotherapy exposure but may also be affected by other crucial risk factors, such as lifestyle, genetic background, environmental factors, and other cancer-related treatments.<sup><xref rid="zoi200984r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Therefore, it is impossible to balance all factors between the 2 treatment types. Instead, we adjusted all confounding risk factors using a multivariable risk competing model to reduce the potential bias associated with the lack of randomization. Second, we could not determine the associations between modality of radiotherapy, radiotherapy dose, and number of administrations and the risk of SGMNs. Third, the SEER database records only the initial treatment information of rectal cancer, and whether patients with rectal cancer received delayed radiotherapy in subsequent treatment is unknown, which may potentially misclassify the patients in the radiotherapy group into the no-radiotherapy group. However, this limitation is unlikely to affect our main conclusion but reflects only an underestimation of the increased risk attributable to radiotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec
