Polygenic risk scores, radiation treatment exposures and subsequent cancer risk in childhood cancer survivors Abstract
Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for subsequent cancers attributable to late effects of radiotherapy and other treatment exposures, but further understanding of the impact of genetic predisposition on risk is needed. Combining genotype data for 11,220 five-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort we found that cancer-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from general population GWAS cancer loci identified survivors of European ancestry at increased risk of subsequent basal cell carcinoma (BCC; odds ratio per PRS standard deviation 1.37, 95% CI 1.29–1.46), female breast cancer (1.42, 1.27–1.58), thyroid cancer (1.48, 1.31–1.67), squamous cell carcinoma (1.20, 1.00–1.44), and melanoma (1.60, 1.31–1.96), but the association for colorectal cancer was not significant (1.19, 0.94–1.52). Investigation of joint associations between PRS and radiotherapy found more-than-additive increased risks of BCC, breast, and thyroid cancers. For survivors with radiotherapy exposure, the cumulative incidence of subsequent cancer by age 50 years was increased for those with high versus low PRS. These findings suggest a degree of shared genetic etiology for these malignancy types in the general population and survivors that remains evident in the context of strong radiotherapy-related risk.
