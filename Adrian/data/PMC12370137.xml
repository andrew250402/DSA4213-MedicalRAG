Introduction</title><p>Digestive system neoplasms, encompassing esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, as well as benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms, are among the most pressing health concerns globally [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Digestive cancers account for approximately 26% of the global cancer incidence and 35% of cancer-related deaths each year, posing significant challenges to public health [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These neoplasms not only substantially reduce patients&#8217; quality of life, shorten their life expectancy, but also impose considerable economic burdens on patients, their families, and healthcare systems [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Geographic disparities in the incidence, mortality, and burden of digestive system neoplasms are particularly pronounced. In 2020, the incidence of gastrointestinal cancers in East Asia accounted for 48.4% of the global total, underscoring the region&#8217;s disproportionately high burden of these diseases, with particularly high rates of stomach, liver, esophageal, and gallbladder cancers compared to other regions [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Contributing factors include distinct dietary patterns, lifestyle behaviors, and the higher prevalence of infectious etiologies in this region [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the contrary, high-income regions such as North America have reported increasing incidences of colorectal and pancreatic cancers, which are largely associated with lifestyle factors including obesity and metabolic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At the sex level, men bear a disproportionately higher burden of digestive system neoplasms. Worldwide, distinct male-to-female incidence ratios are observed across specific subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancers, with males significantly outnumbering females in all subtypes, and the highest ratio observed for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) at 6.7:1 [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For colorectal cancer, the incidence of colon cancer is approximately 41.2 per 100,000 person-years in men, compared to 32.4 in women, while rectal cancer incidence is 22.8 versus 12.6, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate that the incidence and mortality of digestive system neoplasms increase with age [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, the incidence of colorectal cancer is concentrated in the age group of 50&#8211;69 years globally [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, pancreatic cancer incidence rates are relatively higher in individuals aged over 65 years, with an upward trend observed, and the average age at diagnosis ranges from 60 to 65 years [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. And between 2000 and 2019, 81.82% of gastric cancer cases occurred in individuals aged 55 years or older [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, gastrointestinal cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stages in elderly patients due to misinterpretation of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the fact that these elderly patients often suffer from multiple chronic comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, which further exacerbates the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although previous studies have systematically analyzed the global burden of digestive system neoplasms, research focusing specifically on middle-aged and elderly populations remains limited and has paid insufficient attention to benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, meaning that existing treatment strategies may not fully meet their special needs. As the global population continues to age, the prevalence and burden of these diseases are expected to escalate further [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study, using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database and advanced statistical methods, seeks to enhance the understanding of this field by focusing on the burden of seven digestive system neoplasms in middle-aged and elderly adults, exploring temporal trends and geographic disparities. By doing so, our study aims to provide tailored insights to inform targeted public health interventions and enhance healthcare strategies for aging populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>2.

The dataset provided estimates of incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across times, sex, age group, and SDI. Our study includes all countries and regions from the GBD database for the period 1990&#8211;2021, focusing on individuals aged 55 and older, both male and female, diagnosed with digestive system neoplasms. These neoplasms include esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colon and rectum cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, and benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms. This systematic characterization of disparities in the burden of digestive neoplasms across regions and populations provides evidence-based insights to inform precision prevention strategies and healthcare prioritization.</p><p>This study quantifies the disease burden of digestive system cancers, including digestive tract cancers (esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and colon and rectum cancer) and digestive support system cancers (liver cancer, gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, and pancreatic cancer), along with benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms, using indicators like incidence, mortality, and DALYs. Notably, DALYs are calculated as the sum of two components: years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs), with detailed definitions available in the <xref rid="pone.0330259.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms are analyzed separately from malignant cancers due to their chronic, non-lethal nature and minimal impact on patients&#8217; quality of life. Therefore, their associated DALYs and deaths are reported as 0 in the GBD study. In GBD 2021, the definitions of seven digestive system neoplasms are mapped to both the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 and ICD-9 codes.

This study specifically focused on analyzing the most granular risk levels, namely levels 2 and 3, for each risk factor associated with digestive system neoplasms. In GBD 2021, the process of estimating risk factor burden involved a series of interconnected methodological steps. First, the relative risk (RR) for health outcomes was calculated based on exposure to specific risk factors. Next, exposure data were gathered and analyzed using Bayesian statistical methods to assess the distribution of risk factors. Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Levels (TMRELs) were then established based on the available epidemiological evidence, aiming to identify optimal exposure thresholds. Subsequently, population-attributable fractions (PAFs) were computed for each risk-outcome pair to quantify potential health improvements if exposure were reduced to the TMREL. Age-specific exposure values (SEVs) were also calculated to reflect exposure prevalence, with adjustments made for age-related risk factors. To refine these estimates, mediation factors were applied to account for indirect relationships between risk factors and outcomes. Finally, attributable burden was estimated by multiplying PAFs with the disease burden, measured in DALYs. These results were stratified by SDI quintiles and presented as counts, age-standardized rates, and rankings [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In our study, esophageal cancer is found to be associated with high alcohol use, smoking, chewing tobacco, and a diet low in vegetables in individuals aged 55 and older. High alcohol use is defined as alcohol consumption exceeding the TMREL, with in GBD 2021 is estimated based on region, age, sex, and year to tailor estimates to specific populations. Alcohol exposure was measured in grams of pure alcohol consumed per day. Smoking and chewing tobacco are defined as the current use of any smoked tobacco product or the use of chewing tobacco, including local products like betel quid with tobacco, in the past 30 days or according to the closest survey definition, regardless of frequency. A diet low in vegetables is defined as consuming fewer than 306&#8211;372&#8201;g/day of vegetables. Stomach cancer is linked to a diet high in sodium and smoking. High sodium intake is defined by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion levels of 1&#8211;5&#8201;g/day. Turning to colon and rectum cancer, a broader range of risk factors are identified. This included diet low in whole grains, high alcohol use, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, diet high in red meat, diet low in calcium, diet low in fiber, diet low in milk, low physical activity, diet high in processed meat, and high body-mass index (BMI). For example, low whole grain consumption is defined as average daily consumption of fewer than 160&#8211;210 grams, while high BMI is defined as greater than 23&#8201;kg/m&#178; for individuals aged 55 and above. Moreover, high FPG is categorized as levels above 4.88&#8211;5.30 mmol/L, and low physical activity is quantified as less than 3600&#8211;4400 MET-minutes per week. High red meat and processed meat consumption are defined as daily consumption of up to 200 grams of unprocessed red meat or any amount of processed meat. Other dietary factors, including low calcium, fiber, and milk intake, were similarly defined based on GBD 2021 thresholds (<xref rid="pone.0330259.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>For liver cancer, the risk factors included smoking, high alcohol use, high FPG, drug use, and high BMI.

A pooled analysis of data from 10 case&#8211;control studies on EAC revealed that smoking doubled the risk of this malignancy [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent with this, our results identified smoking as the leading global risk factor for esophageal cancer, with particularly high proportional contributions in East Asia and High-income North America. Notably, in South Asia, chewing tobacco emerged as a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer. For gastric cancer, a 2020 meta-analysis encompassing 232 studies found that current smoking increased the odds of developing gastric cancer by 61% [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our study further confirmed that smoking and a high-sodium diet were the most critical global risk factors for gastric cancer, with more pronounced impacts observed in East Asia and High-income North America. In the case of colon and rectum cancer, dietary factors were particularly prominent. Low intake of whole grains, milk, and calcium, coupled with high red meat consumption, were major global contributors to the disease burden. Additionally, BMI and FPG exerted substantial impacts, especially in High-income North America and Central Latin America.</p><p>Liver cancer showed a strong association with alcohol use, with the highest proportional contribution observed in Central Europe. For gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, high BMI was the most influential factor across regions, with North Africa and the Middle East experiencing the highest burdens. A meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies confirmed that overweight individuals had a 1.10-fold higher relative risk of gallbladder cancer (95% CI: 1.02&#8211;1.18), and obesity was associated with a 1.69-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.54&#8211;1.86), showing a dose-response relationship [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For pancreatic cancer, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and high BMI emerged as three key risk factors worldwide. Interestingly, high BMI appeared to act as a protective factor in some regions. Specifically, in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and High-income Asia Pacific, the attributable DALYs were &#8722;9.20&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#8308;(95% UI: &#8722;9.88&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#179; to 1.31&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#178;), &#8722;1.51&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#179; (95% UI: &#8722;1.14&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#178; to 1.45&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#178;), and &#8722;8.83&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#179; (95% UI: &#8722;2.02&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#178; to 7.38&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;&#8315;&#8201;&#179;), respectively.

Discussion</title><p>This study comprehensively analyzes the global burden and temporal trends of seven major digestive system neoplasms among middle-aged and elderly populations from 1990 to 2021. The findings highlight distinct patterns in disease distribution, risk factor impacts, and evolving trends, with critical implications for public health strategies.</p><p>In 2021, the majority of cases, deaths, and DALYs associated with these cancers were concentrated in individuals aged 65&#8211;74, with incidence rates generally increasing with age. This age-related trend may be partially linked to immunosenescence, long-term cumulative exposure to risk factors, and the accumulation of chronic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Males consistently exhibited higher incidence, mortality, and DALY burdens for most digestive system neoplasms, particularly esophageal, stomach, and liver cancers. This disparity was likely associated with the higher prevalence of high-risk behaviors among males, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy dietary patterns, and insufficient physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, higher concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone have been linked to increased gastric and liver cancer risks in men [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, females exhibited higher rates of gallbladder and biliary tract cancers, which may partly be attributed to the higher occurrence of gallstones, a recognized risk factor for gallbladder cancer [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies suggest that reproductive and menstrual factors may be linked to gallbladder cancer, highlighting the potential role of female hormones in its etiology. However, the findings remain inconsistent, necessitating further research to clarify the specific mechanisms underlying their role [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These sex-specific disparities in digestive system cancers necessitate sex-responsive prevention and intervention strategies. For males, public health policies should prioritize primary prevention, such as intensifying tobacco and alcohol control measures and encouraging regular physical activity. For females, more proactive screening and monitoring of gallbladder and biliary tract diseases are essential, particularly for individuals with gallstones or relevant reproductive histories. Such tailored approaches are crucial to improving the precision and effectiveness of efforts to control digestive system neoplasms.</p><p>Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, and elevated FPG are major global risk factors for digestive system neoplasms, with their impact and distribution varying significantly across different SDI levels. Smoking, a leading risk factor for esophageal cancer, exerts carcinogenic effects through mechanisms such as inducing genetic mutations in esophageal cells, promoting chronic inflammation-mediated epithelial remodeling, and hurting the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In East Asia, persistently high male smoking rates likely sustain the region&#8217;s elevated esophageal cancer burden despite global declines [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, the use of betel nut-tobacco mixtures remained prevalent in certain South Asian countries, resulting in persistent direct contact between carcinogens the esophageal mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These compounds may synergistically increase the risk of esophageal cancer through mechanisms such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters like p16 and genetic mutations in genes such as p53 [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, our results indicate that lifestyle factors, particularly a high-sodium diet, contribute significantly to the burden of stomach cancer in middle-aged and elderly populations, especially in East Asian countries. Reducing the intake of high-salt foods has been proposed as one strategy to address the stomach cancer issue in high-risk Asian countries [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Dietary factors play a central role in colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly a low intake of whole grains and a high intake of red and processed meats. This has been confirmed by the National Institutes of Health and American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study, which found that whole grain consumption, but not dietary fiber from other sources, is inversely associated with CRC risk [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, a high intake of red and processed meats has been shown to increase CRC risk through mechanisms such as gut microbiota imbalance and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, promoting healthy diets rich in whole grains, low in processed foods, and implementing stronger regulations on processed meat products could play a crucial role in reducing the burden of colorectal cancer. As the elderly population experiences a rising incidence of obesity, high BMI has become a key contributor to the growing burden of gallbladder and biliary tract cancers. Health promotion initiatives, including educational campaigns and community empowerment, are crucial for changing lifestyle and dietary habits to prevent obesity [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Elevated FPG and smoking are recognized as major risk factors for pancreatic cancer, but their interactive effects remain unclear. A large nationwide cohort study in Korea, involving over 9 million adults, found that current smokers with diabetes or prediabetes had a synergistically increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR&#8201;=&#8201;2.72) compared to never-smokers with normoglycemia [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In contrast, a 10-year prospective cohort study of 446,407 Korean men confirmed that smoking and elevated fasting glucose act as independent risk factors for pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>From 1990 to 2021, the global burden of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, gallbladder cancer, and biliary tract cancer exhibited a declining trend. This positive change resulted from the combined effects of global public health interventions, risk factor control, and improvements in medical care. In particular, the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and the implementation of early endoscopic screening played crucial roles in reducing the burden of stomach and esophageal cancers [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Conversely, the global burden of pancreatic cancer rose steadily, with both incidence and mortality increasing, largely driven by population aging [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, due to the lack of effective early screening methods and the disease&#8217;s high fatality rate, both direct medical costs and indirect economic losses associated with pancreatic cancer steadily increased [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It was suggested that preventive strategies should prioritize primary prevention, focus on modifiable risk factors, such as reducing smoking and controlling obesity and diabetes, to mitigate the burden of disease [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>For colon and rectum cancer, screening plays a dual role in driving the paradox of rising incidence and falling mortality. On one hand, the widespread adoption of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy in Western countries has significantly enhanced the detection of early lesions [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, screening directly reduces mortality. Colonoscopy allows for the removal of precancerous polyps lower the risk of post-procedure colorectal cancer by blocking the disease at precancerous or early stages [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Additionally, optimized 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy further improves outcomes in advanced cases [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Regarding liver cancer, the decline in mortality from virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma was largely attributed to hepatitis B vaccination programs, antiviral therapies, and improvements in chronic liver disease management [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, with the rising prevalence of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, the overall incidence of liver cancer continued to increase [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It was also noteworthy that the incidence of benign and in situ intestinal neoplasms rose sharply, predominantly in high-SDI countries. This trend reflected expanded screening coverage and increased public health awareness, leading to earlier detection of asymptomatic lesions. For example, in the Netherlands&#8217; nationwide colon and rectum cancer screening program, numerous inflammatory polyps and early-stage tumors were detected [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>High-SDI countries have made significant strides in reducing mortality from digestive system neoplasms, driven by comprehensive cancer screening, early diagnosis, and well-developed treatment systems [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, middle and low-SDI countries face persistent challenges due to limited screening coverage, inadequate chronic disease management, and constrained healthcare resources, leading to higher rates of late-stage diagnoses and sustained disease burden [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. To alleviate the global burden of digestive system neoplasms in Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults, targeted policy and practical measures should be prioritized. First, cost-effective, population-based screening programs, such as FOBT for colorectal cancer or endoscopic screening for gastric cancer, should be tailored to local contexts, with an emphasis on expanding coverage for high-risk middle-aged and elderly populations in resource-limited settings. Second, primary prevention must be strengthened through public health policies promoting physical activity, scaling up tobacco cessation programs, and regulating harmful products like sugar-sweetened beverages to address metabolic risk factors such as obesity and hyperglycemia [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Third, healthcare capacity in low and middle-SDI regions must be strengthened by investing in diagnostic and treatment infrastructure, training healthcare professionals, and utilizing telemedicine to ensure timely access to care for elderly populations [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Finally, collaboration between academia, healthcare providers, and industry should be fostered to accelerate advances in early detection and precision medicine, exemplified by initiatives like the U.S. &#8220;Cancer Moonshot&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0330259.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. By integrating these strategies, global efforts can address the burden of digestive system neoplasms in middle-aged and elderly populations, while also tackling the underlying metabolic drivers, leading to more equitable health outcomes.</p><p>This study, based on data from the GBD Study 2021, systematically assesses the global burden of digestive system neoplasms among middle-aged and elderly populations. Nevertheless, several limitations warrant consideration. First, in certain low- and middle-income countries, the limited availability of high-quality epidemiological data may compromise model-based estimates due to data gaps and diagnostic biases. Second, the GBD applies standardized disease definitions, which may not fully capture histological diversity or borderline cases, potentially leading to an underestimation of the true disease burden. Furthermore, the attribution of risk factors relies on literature reviews and theoretical minimum risk exposure levels, which may not encompass all relevant exposures or adequately reflect long-term, population-specific variations. Third, this study does not account for subnational heterogeneity, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings to regional policy planning Future research should prioritize the integration of real-world data and longitudinal cohort studies to better characterize disease heterogeneity and population-specific features, ultimately informing the development of more targeted and effective prevention strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, digestive system neoplasms remain a major global public health issue among middle-aged and elderly populations, with clear temporal trends and regional disparities observed between 1990 and 2021. Despite significant progress in early screening and treatment, the mortality rates for colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer have declined, while the incidence of these cancers, along with pancreatic cancer and benign tumors, continues to rise. This trend is primarily attributed to changes in lifestyle and the increasing prevalence of metabolic risk factors. In contrast, the burden of esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and gallbladder/biliary tract cancer has decreased, reflecting the effectiveness of public health interventions. With the aging global population, the burden of digestive system neoplasms is likely to increase further. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen early screening, health education, and risk factor management, as well as promote advances in precision medicine, particularly in low- and middle-SDI regions. Enhancing public health infrastructure and healthcare access is critical to mitigating this growing health burden.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0330259.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>EAPC of death rates for digestive system neoplasms in global and regional populations of middle-aged and elderly adults (1990&#8211;2021).</title><p>(A) Esophageal cancer.
