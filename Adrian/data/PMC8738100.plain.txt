Subsequent malignant neoplasms in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study: Occurrence of cancer types where human papillomavirus is an established etiologic risk factor Abstract
Background:
Human papillomavirus-associated subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNHPV) in childhood cancer survivors are poorly understood.
Methods:
SMNHPV cumulative risk was assessed among 24,363 Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk (AER) were calculated using age-, sex- and calendar year rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Poisson regression models identified SMNHPV risk factors, evaluating relative SIRs (rSIR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI).
Results:
46 survivors developed an SMNHPV (median age of 31 years [range: 10-56], median time from primary cancer of 21 years [range: 9-35]). SMNHPV locations included oropharynx (N=44), anorectum (N=6), uterine cervix (N=2), vulva (N=2). Thirty-year cumulative incidence was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2%-0.4%) and SIR was nearly three-fold the general population (SIR=2.86, 95% CI 2.05-4.00). Female survivors were not at increased risk of cervical or vulvar cancers compared to the general population. All survivors had an elevated risk of oropharyngeal (Males SIR=4.06, 95% CI 2.37-6.97; Females SIR=8.44, 95% CI 4.88-14.61) and anorectal (Males SIR=13.56, 95% CI 5.09-36.13; Females SIR=9.15, 95% CI 2.29-36.61) SMNHPV. Males (vs. females, rSIR=1.99, CI 1.00-3.94), head/neck/pelvic RT dose >3000 cGy (vs none, rSIR=2.35, CI 1.11-4.97), and cisplatin-equivalent dose >400 mg/m2 (vs none, rSIR=4.51, CI: 1.78-11.43) were associated with increased SMNHPV SIRs in multivariable analysis.
Conclusion:
Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for SMN in locations susceptible to HPV-associated malignancies. Further research examining HPV in the etiology of SMN and the promotion of HPV vaccination and surveillance guidelines for SMNHPV in cancer survivors is warranted. Precis
Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for secondary malignant neoplasms in locations associated with HPV infection.
