Clinical Factors Associated with Skin Neoplasms in Individuals with Lynch Syndrome in a Longitudinal Observational Cohort Abstract
Background:
Little is known about patient-specific risk factors for skin neoplasia in individuals with Lynch Syndrome (LS).
Objective:
Identify clinical factors associated with development of skin neoplasms in LS.
Methods:
Clinical data were systematically collected on a cohort of LS carriers (confirmed pathogenic germline variants [PGVs] in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or EPCAM) age ≥18 undergoing clinical genetics care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1/2000–3/2020. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate clinical factors associated with skin neoplasia.
Results:
Of 607 LS carriers, 9.2% had LS-associated skin neoplasia and 15.0% had non-LS-associated skin neoplasia. 58.2% (353/607) had documentation of prior dermatologic evaluation. 29.7% (38/128) with skin neoplasms lacked a history of visceral LS-associated malignancy. LS-associated skin neoplasms were significantly associated with male sex, age, race, MLH1 PGVs, MSH2/EPCAM PGVs, and personal history of non-LS skin neoplasms. Non-LS-associated skin neoplasms was significantly associated with age, number of first- and second-degree relatives with non-LS-associated skin neoplasms, and personal history of LS-associated skin neoplasms.
Limitations:
Single-institution observational study; demographic homogeneity.
Conclusions:
Skin neoplasms are common in individuals with LS. We identified clinical factors associated with LS- and non-LS-associated skin neoplasms. Regular dermatologic surveillance should be considered for all LS carriers.
