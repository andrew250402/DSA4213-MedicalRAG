Germline risk factors for second malignant neoplasms after treatment for pediatric hematologic malignancies Abstract
Survivors of childhood hematologic malignancies are at a substantially higher risk of developing subsequent neoplasms (SNs) when compared with the general population. SNs commonly observed in this population include basal cell carcinoma, brain tumors, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, bone tumors, and sarcoma. Radiation is the primary therapeutic exposure associated with the development of these SNs. There is emerging evidence of an association between chemotherapeutic exposures (alkylating agents/anthracyclines) and the development of SNs. Despite a strong dose-dependent association between therapeutic exposures and SN risk, there is significant interindividual variability in the risk for SNs for any given dose of therapeutic exposure. This interindividual variability in risk suggests the role of genetic susceptibility. This article describes the clinical and molecular epidemiology of SNs commonly observed in survivors of childhood hematologic malignancies and also highlights some of the work focusing on the development of risk prediction models to facilitate targeted interventions.
