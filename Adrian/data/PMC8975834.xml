IFN&#945; is highly effective in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), but the mechanisms of action are unclear and it remains unknown why some patients respond to IFN&#945; and others do not. Here, we identify and characterize a pathway involving PKC&#948;-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 on serine residues 341 and 495, required for subsequent activation of p38 MAPK. We show that this pathway is essential for IFN-suppressive effects on primary malignant erythroid precursors from MPN patients, and that increased levels of ULK1 and p38 MAPK correlate with clinical response to IFN&#945; therapy in these patients. We also demonstrate that IFN&#945; treatment induces cleavage/activation of the ULK1-interacting ROCK1/2 proteins in vitro and in vivo, triggering a negative feedback loop that suppresses IFN responses. Overexpression of ROCK1/2 is seen in MPN patients and their genetic or pharmacological inhibition enhances IFN-anti-neoplastic responses in malignant erythroid precursors from MPN patients. These findings suggest the clinical potential of pharmacological inhibition of ROCK1/2 in combination with IFN-therapy for the treatment of MPNs.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) therapy is showing promising results to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

In co-immunoprecipitation assays using two <italic toggle="yes">JAK2</italic><sup>V617F</sup>-expressing leukemia cell lines, we found ULK1 associated with PKC&#948;, both before and after IFN&#945;-treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>).

These results raised the possibility that IFN could stimulate PKC&#948;-induced phosphorylation of ULK1.

ULK1 WT and Ser-to-Ala ULK1 mutants were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, inactivated, and used as substrates for purified active GST-PKC&#948; in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-ATP in kinase assays (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). While replacement of Ser467 by Ala did not result in an obvious alteration of phosphorylation, mutation of Ser341 to Ala (S341A) and Ser495 to Ala (S495A) reduced phosphorylation of ULK1 by PKC&#948; (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Additionally, this reduction was more evident for the triple mutant (SSS/AAA) ULK1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). These results suggest that PKC&#948; directly phosphorylates ULK1 on both Ser341 and Ser495 residues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), which prompted us to generate two phospho-specific ULK1 antibodies, one recognizing ULK1 phosphorylated on Ser<sup>341</sup> and the other recognizing ULK1 phosphorylated on Ser<sup>495</sup>. We confirmed the specificity of the antibodies using <italic toggle="yes">Ulk1/2</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transfected with myc-tagged empty vector, ULK1 WT, ULK1 S341A and ULK1 S495A mutants (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). The p-Ser<sup>341</sup>ULK1 antibody gave a strong signal in the <italic toggle="yes">Ulk1/2</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> cells transfected with both ULK1 WT and ULK1 S495A mutant, but not in cells transfected with empty vector or the ULK1 S341A mutant. Likewise, the p-Ser<sup>495</sup>ULK1 antibody gave a strong signal in the <italic toggle="yes">Ulk1/2</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> cells transfected with both ULK1 WT and ULK1 S341A mutant, but not in the cells transfected with empty vector or ULK1 S495A mutant, confirming the specificity of these antibodies (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). Next, using <italic toggle="yes">Ulk1/2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of ULK1 on both Ser341 and Ser495 is induced by IFN&#945; treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Moreover, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKC&#948; in U937 cells, we show that PKC&#948; expression is required for IFN&#945;-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 on Ser341 and Ser495, but not on Ser757, an AKT/mTOR phosphorylation site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#8211;c</xref>). As ULK1 is required for IFN-mediated activation of p38 MAPK, leading to transcription of ISGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we next sought to determine whether phosphorylation of ULK1 on Ser341 and Ser495 residues is essential for IFN-induced activation of p38 MAPK. To this end, we overexpressed myc-tagged empty vector, ULK1 WT, ULK1 S341A and ULK1 S495A in <italic toggle="yes">Ulk1/2</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> MEFs. These cells were then treated with IFN&#945; and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was assessed. ULK1 WT, but not the ULK1 S/A mutants, could rescue IFN&#945;-induced activation of p38 MAPK (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Additionally, we overexpressed myc-tagged empty vector, ULK1 WT, ULK1 S341A and ULK1 S495A in <italic toggle="yes">ULK1</italic> KO KT-1 cells. ULK1 protein expression or its absence was confirmed by anti-ULK1 immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The different transfected cells were then either left untreated or were treated with IFN&#945; for 6&#8201;h and the mRNA expression of ISGs was evaluated by qRT-PCR analysis. In contrast with ULK1 S341A and ULK1 S495A, expression of the ULK1 WT substantially increased the IFN&#945;-induced expression of <italic toggle="yes">IFIT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">OAS1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">IFIT3</italic> compared to empty vector-transfected <italic toggle="yes">ULK1</italic> KO KT-1 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f&#8211;h</xref>). Moreover, siRNA-mediated targeted inhibition of PKC&#948; expression reversed the suppressive effects of IFN&#945; on primitive malignant erythroid precursors (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Thus, as previously shown for ULK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and p38 MAPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, PKC&#948; engagement by activation of IFNAR is essential for the suppressive effects of IFN&#945; on primary malignant PV progenitors, in vitro. Taken together these results provide evidence of previously unknown signaling events, in which activation of IFNAR controls PKC&#948;-mediated ULK1 phosphorylation on Ser341 and Ser495 and that ULK1 phosphorylation at these sites is required for downstream activation of p38 MAPK and transcription of ISGs.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Type I IFN-induced PKC&#948;-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 on serine residues 341 and 495 is required for ULK1-mediated activation of p38 MAPK and consequent expression of ISGs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> U937 cells were transfected with either control siRNA or PKC&#948; siRNA. 24&#8201;h later, cells were starved overnight (cultured in RPMI medium without FBS) and then were either left untreated or were treated with IFN&#945; (10<sup>4</sup>&#8201;IU/mL) for 10 or 30&#8201;min, as indicated.

A precise understanding of the mechanisms of action of type I IFNs on both tumor and immune cells is critical, as this will provide the means to identify, in advance, patients who will respond to IFN treatment and thereby predict clinical responses. Moreover, this knowledge will lead to new therapeutic approaches and the development of combination treatments to enhance the action(s) of IFNs and/or overcome resistance mechanisms. It is well established that activation of IFNAR initiates signaling events mediated via the classical JAK/STAT pathway and many other &#8220;non-classical&#8221; pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

We now identify PKC&#948; as a key initiator of the p38 MAPK pathway and demonstrate that PKC&#948; binds to and directly phosphorylates ULK1 on serine residues 341 and 495. We establish that phosphorylation of ULK1 on these sites is required for downstream engagement of p38 MAPK and transcription of ISGs. Activation of PKC&#948; is critical for the generation of IFN responses, as we provide evidence that PKC&#948; knockdown reverses the IFN&#945;-mediated anti-clonogenic effects in PV patient primary cells. Using MPN patient samples collected prior to initiation of PEG-IFN&#945; therapy, we observed that higher baseline expression levels of the downstream effectors of PKC&#948;, namely ULK1 and p38 MAPK, predict a better response to IFN&#945; treatment. These findings suggest that ULK1 and p38 MAPK could potentially be used as part of a pool of biomarkers to predict response to IFN&#945;-based therapies for MPN patients, but future large prospective clinical studies will be required to definitively address this.</p><p id="Par14">In previous studies, PKC&#948; has been characterized as both a tumor-promoting and a tumor-suppressing kinase, dependent on the stimulus and cell-type context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Two-way ANOVA was used to compare groups in experiments with two independent variables (factors) with Tukey&#8217;s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons correction. For the experiments using MPN-patient-derived primary cells, differences between experimental conditions were analyzed using linear mixed effects models with patient as a random effect to account for the within-subject correlation between multiple conditions. Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment was used, and pairwise group comparison tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Tukey&#8217;s method. The statistical analysis performed for each dataset is included in the figure legends. Differences were considered statistically significant when <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values were less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par50">Further information on research design is available in the&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
