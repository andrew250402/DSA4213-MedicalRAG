To address this challenge, we developed Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), integrating genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. We applied GoT to study how somatic mutations corrupt the complex process of human hematopoiesis, profiling 38,290 CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from patients with <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic>-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). High-resolution mapping of malignant vs. normal hematopoietic progenitors revealed increasing <italic toggle="yes">CALR-</italic>mutation fitness advantage with myeloid differentiation. We identified the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> mutations, with significant cell identity dependency, as well as NF-&#954;B pathway upregulation specifically in uncommitted stem cells. We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci distant from transcript ends. Collectively, these findings revealed that the transcriptional output of MPN somatic mutations is dependent on the native cell identity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Single-cell</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>genotyping</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>myeloproliferative neoplasms</kwd><kwd>somatic evolution</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P6">Somatic mutations underlie the development of clonal outgrowth, malignant transformation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, and subclonal diversification<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, clonally-derived populations often lack cell surface markers that distinguish them from normal cells or that can help distinguish subclones, limiting the ability to link the clonal architecture of malignant populations with transcriptional read-outs. For example, while myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) result from recurrent somatic mutations in <italic toggle="yes">CALR, JAK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MPL</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, the mutated clone often represents a subset of bone marrow progenitors without distinctive surface markers to distinguish them from non-neoplastic hematopoietic cells. Thus, we are unable to study the impact of MPN mutations in the context of their progenitor subtype identity.</p><p id="P7">Although advanced methods have been developed to capture both transcriptional information and genotype at the single-cell level<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, these methods are limited in throughput, and thus are challenged to study complex systems such as hematopoietic differentiation. Droplet-based sequencing enables the transcriptomic profiling of thousands of cells<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and can potentially also provide genotypic information of coding mutations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). However, current methods, by design, provide sequence information for only a short fragment at the transcript end, limiting the ability to jointly genotype somatic mutations. To overcome this challenge, we developed Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) to link genotypes of expressed genes to transcriptional profiling of thousands of single-cells. We applied GoT to CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from MPN patients, which revealed that MPN mutations in hematopoietic progenitor cells do not lead to uniform transcriptional outputs, but rather show strong dependence on progenitor subset identity.</p><sec id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) couples targeted cDNA genotyping with single-cell whole transcriptomes to reveal that <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> mutant progenitor cells are comingled with wildtype cells throughout differentiation</title><p id="P8">To link genotypes to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) in high-throughput droplet-based platforms, we modified the 10x Genomics platform (Pleasanton, CA) to amplify the targeted transcript and locus of interest (<xref rid="S9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). We then interrogated amplicon reads for mutational status, and linked the genotype to single-cell gene expression profiles via shared cell barcodes (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). We tested the ability of GoT to co-map single-cell genotypes and transcriptomes with a species-mixing experiment, wherein mouse cells with a mutant <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> transgene were mixed with human cells with a wildtype <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> transgene (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.

We therefore applied GoT to CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells from five patients with <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic>-mutated essential thrombocythemia (ET), not treated with disease-modifying therapy at the time of biopsy (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> genotyping data were available for 16,614 of 18,722 cells (88.7%), compared to only 1.4% by interrogation of <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> in the conventional 10x Genomics data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To interrogate the cellular identities of these progenitors, we performed clustering agnostic to the genotyping information, based on the transcriptome information alone (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

Thus, while <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> mutations arise in uncommitted HSCs and, therefore, propagate to populate the entire differentiation tree, the impact of <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> mutations on fitness increases with myeloid differentiation (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>,<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">e</xref>).</p><p id="P12">GoT uniquely enables direct transcriptional program comparison between mutant and wildtype cells, not only within the same sample, but also within the same progenitor cluster.

Indeed, while mutant HSPCs exhibited only a modest increase in cell cycle gene expression compared to wildtype (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.015, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, mean fold change 1.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.1&#8211;1.4), mutant MkPs demonstrated a robust increase in cell cycle expression vs. their wildtype counterparts (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 4.4 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, fold change 1.8 [1.4&#8211;2.8]; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Notably, the degree of cell cycle gene expression increase in mutant MkPs correlated with the patients&#8217; platelet counts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that interrogation of the early progenitor cells may correlate with clinical phenotypes and inform our understanding of patient-to-patient variability despite shared mutated genotypes.</p><p id="P13">Cell-to-cell variation exists even within progenitor clusters.

Relying on complementary overhang at both end of the amplicon, circularization was performed in a large volume (&gt;1 mL) to favor intra-molecule ligation. The following reaction was set-up and incubated overnight at 16&#176;C: USERII-digested amplicon, 2000 U/mL T4 ligase (NEB), 1X CutSmart Buffer (NEB), 1 mM ATP (Roche). Next, T4 DNA ligase was inactivated by incubating for 15&#8217; at 70&#176;C.

Briefly, for individual datasets, cells with UMI &lt;200 or UMI &gt;3 standard deviation from the mean UMI and mitochondrial gene percentage &gt;10% were filtered. The data was log normalized using a scale factor of 10,000. Prior to clustering, the ET and MF datasets were integrated and underwent batch-correction which implements canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principles of mutual nearest neighbor. Recommended settings were used for the integration (i.e., 30 canonical correlation vectors for CCA in the FindIntegrationAnchors function and 30 principle components for the anchor weighting procedure in IntegrateData function). For the datasets, potential confounders (e.g., number of UMI per cell and the proportion of mitochondrial genes) were regressed out of the data before principle component analysis (PCA) was performed using variable genes. JackStraw method was used to determine the statistically significant PCs to be used for graph-based clustering. t-SNE was used to visualize the clusters.

For CB reads that were 1-Hamming-distance away from the whitelisted CB, the probability that the observed barcode originated from the whitelisted CB was calculated taking into account the base quality (BQ) score at the differing base. The whitelisted CB with the highest probability was used to replace the observed CB, only if the probability exceeded 0.99. For the duplicate reads with the same CB and UMI, the genotype (wildtype vs. mutant) of the UMI was assigned based on majority rule in supporting reads or according to the read with the highest BQ score in the rare case when only two supporting but discordant reads were available.</p><p id="P37">The species-mixing study for <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> (type 1) mutation was used to further optimize to optimize the analytical assignment of genotypes to cells, to overcome technical sources of noise such as PCR errors, ambient mRNA and PCR recombination, which may accompany targeted amplification in scRNA-seq. A mean (&#177; standard deviation) of 83.6 (&#177; 95.3) <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> UMIs were detected per cell in the amplicon data, with 52 (&#177; 16.3) reads per UMI.

Setting thresholds for the minimum number of duplicate reads and maximum frequency of mismatches contributed significantly to filtering out mis-assigned reads likely due to technical errors (e.g. PCR recombinations). A combination of threshold of two or more duplicate reads for a given UMI and a threshold of allowing less than or equal to 0.2 mismatch ratio significantly improved correct assignment of cells, while maximizing the number of included cells for analysis, and was adopted in the analysis here (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>).

This may be due to incomplete sampling of the transcript pool or due to transcriptional bursts<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, which leads to skewed transcript pools. Consequently, as the number of UMIs per cell increases, the likelihood of capturing a mutant transcript increases, resulting in an apparently higher frequency of mutated cells. Thus, the number of mutant reads may be underestimated in cells with lower amplicon UMI counts. Nonetheless, the frequency of mutant cells (e.g., 26% in patient sample ET01) as determined by GoT using all cells that harbor at least one UMI yielded values that were similar to that determined by bulk DNA exon sequencing of <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (mutant cell fraction of 30% based on VAF of 0.15 in a diploid heterozygous mutation). While the bulk of the downstream analyses between <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> mutant and wildtype cells used a threshold of two or greater genotyping amplicon UMIs, we systematically applied three approaches to exclude the impact of this confounder (i.e., expression level of target gene) on the conclusions. First, to exclude the possibility that higher <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> expression in committed progenitors can result in greater ability to detect mutant alleles and thereby result in higher mutated cell frequency, we down-sampled all cells to a single amplicon UMI prior to mutation calling and found that the increase in mutation frequencies in MkP compared with HSPC remained unchanged (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Second, we explored the sensitivity of the difference between mutant and wildtype cells (e.g. pseudotime, mutant cell frequency) by increasing the minimal amplicon UMI threshold allowed for mutation calling and demonstrated that this did not impact the central findings of this study (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Third, we explicitly modeled the impact of <italic toggle="yes">CALR</italic> amplicon UMI in multivariable models (generalized linear model using R Stats package v3.5.1, e.g., pseudotime analysis), in which the number of amplicon UMI was included in the model alongside the mutation status (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). We further note that the GoT procedure did not result in significant loss of genes or UMIs per cell in comparison to published data of CD34<sup>+</sup> selected cells from the standard 10x library (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>.
