Genetic and epigenetic bases of long-term adverse effects of childhood cancer therapy Abstract
Over the past decade, genome-scale molecular profiling of large childhood cancer survivorship cohorts has led to unprecedented advances in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic bases of therapy-related adverse health outcomes in this vulnerable population. To facilitate the integration of knowledge generated from these studies into formulating next-generation precision care for survivors of childhood cancer, we summarize key findings of genetic and epigenetic association studies of long-term therapy-related adverse effects including subsequent neoplasms and cardiomyopathies among others. We also discuss therapy-related genotoxicities including clonal haematopoiesis and DNA methylation, which may underlie accelerated molecular ageing. Finally, we highlight enhanced risk prediction models for survivors of childhood cancer that incorporate both genetic factors and treatment exposures, aiming to achieve enhanced accuracy in predicting risks for this population. These new insights will hopefully inspire future studies that harness both expanding omics resources and evolving data science methodology to accelerate the translation of precision medicine for survivors of childhood cancer.
